# NLP_StanceDetection
Stance Detection on Cancer related Tweets


The list of todos are:

1) Increase the annotation of the dataset for the 3 major categories : X_causes_cancer, X_cures_cancer, X_prevents_cancer (at least 1000 for each category). 

2) Develop some initial classification model for identifying relevant tweets for each of these 3 classes (a binary classifier that says whether tweets have the particular information in them or not.)

3) Given the tweets which have medical relevance, extract the information from the tweets about the object that causes, cures, prevents cancer. 

4) Finally identify the stance of the object in each of this regard.
